The solution involves carefully reviewing the class hierarchy and media queries to identify the conflict.

One common approach is to use more specific class names or to refactor the CSS to better manage the responsive behavior.

For example, we can make the grid columns explicit for each breakpoint, avoiding unintentional overrides:

```html
<div class="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
  <div class="bg-blue-500 p-4">
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="bg-red-500 p-4">
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
  <div class="bg-green-500 p-4">
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</div>
```
This solution offers greater control over the grid layout, avoiding conflicts that might arise from implicit class interactions.
